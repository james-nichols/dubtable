DubTable
========

PureData patches to run The Dubtable, a Reactable based project to mix mad dub trax. Originally built in 2009 for the Peats Ridge Fest, I dragged the Dubtable around for another 3 years to random events and festivals. In 2011 I introduced a new interface and some new tracks. See http://vimeo.com/22110433 for some video evidence.

How to run
==========

At present the main patch to open is "DubTable v2.0.pd". It works with a predefined set of dub loops recorded by myself with Luke Dubber on keys, Angus Stuart on drums, and Eden Ottignon on bass. If you want to recreate the DubTable please contact me personally for permission to use the loops, and I can provide them to you.

You will need to create the table and the tactile blocks. More info on this to come soon.

Also coming soon - principles of operation and a few words of wisdom about running an interactive sound work like this late at night at crazy festivals where everyone's out of their minds.

Issues
======

I haven't even looked at these patches for about a year or two, so I'm not sure what issues there may be, but I'll hopefully dig up any inconsistencies over the next few weeks.
